As coders, unlike most other fields, we're encouraged to copy from each other.
Of course, I don't mean outright plaigiarism, but taking inspiration from
someone else's code / design or copying some bits is generally acceptable. I
love that about my field. üòç

### People I've learnt from

I would like to acknowledge and thank the kind coders I've learnt or copied
from. I imagine this will become a huge list in no time.
