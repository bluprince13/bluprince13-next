As coders, unlike most other fields, we're encouraged to copy from each
other. Of course, I don't mean outright plaigiarism, but taking inspiration from
someone else's code / design or copying some bits is generally acceptable. I
love that about my field. üòç

I thought it'd be nice to have this page where I can acknowledge and thank the
kind coders I've learnt or copied from. I imagine this will become a huge list
in no time.
