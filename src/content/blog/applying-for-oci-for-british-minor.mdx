I am a British citizen with an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card. My wife is an Indian citizen with a UK spouse visa. In 2025, our first child was born in the UK with British citizenship. We planned to take him to India after he was 6 months old to see the rest of our family.

I considered a tourist e-visa for its convenience, but at £127 [[HCI - visa fee structure](https://www.hcilondon.gov.in/page/visa-fee-structure/)] it felt expensive. An OCI application, although it costs £215, only needs to be renewed when a new passport is issued after completing 20 years of age [[HCI - OCI renewal 18.11.2021](https://www.hcilondon.gov.in/docs/1637214490OCIRenewal18112021.pdf)]. Therefore, despite the hassle of attending an appointment, I felt it was more prudent to apply for OCI right away. With an OCI, my child can travel to India without a visa.

In this article, I describe my experience applying for my child's OCI when he was about 3 months old, and I hope it helps others going through the same process.

## Timeline

Here is a timeline of the events. In particular, note that you need to legalise the child's UK birth certificate before applying for OCI. Therefore, allow for a month before you can submit the OCI application.

## Apostille on UK birth Certificate

I had to go to VFS twice, because the 1st time I didn't have an apostilled birth certificate and VFS refused to submit the application. The guidance was changed in June 2025, and it is now mandatory to have an apostille.

The process is pretty straightforward. Go to the [gov.uk - Get your document legalised
](https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised/apply-for-legalisation) and follow the instructions. It costs £45 plus £5.50 courier charges. You will have to take a printout of the cover sheet and send that and the birth certificate via post. I used a hardback envelope to protect the birth certificate. They also sent back the birth certificate in a hardback envelope, fortunately. The apostille is just a piece of paper that they stick onto the back of the birth certificate

## Prepare 2"x2" photo

You can see the official requirements for the photo here: [Requirement of photograph for OCI Registration](https://ociservices.gov.in/Photo-Spec-FINAL.pdf). It allows for some flexibility for babies and children under 10 years old.

Getting a good photo was hard! I used my camera to take a photo. A mobile phone would also work. We put him down in his cot with a white bed sheet and took a photo during the day when there was a lot of daylight. We took lots of photos to ensure we got a good one where he was looking at the camera with a blank-ish expression.

I cropped it down to 2"x2" using [darktable](https://www.darktable.org/) - which is not very easy to use, but you can use any tool you feel comfortable with. We didn't strictly follow the photo guidelines, but just made sure his face took up about 80% of the photo with just the top of his shoulders visible.

At the appointment, they said they'd prefer a solid white background. Therefore, I used [Photoroom](https://www.photoroom.com/tools/background-remover) to edit the background.

Finally, I ordered 6 copies (although you only need 2) from [OddPrints](https://www.oddprints.com/). This cost just under £5.

## Prepare thumbprint photo

It is ridiculous that a thumbprint is required for children who cannot sign! It was even harder than the photo.

We got a fingerprint ink pad from Amazon. Once he was asleep, we firmly pressed his thumb against the pad. We folded an A4 sheet of paper (which makes it easier to hold), and then pressed his thumb on the paper a few times so we could choose the best one. We cleaned his thumb with wet cotton wool. Fortunately, he was still asleep at the end of the process. :)

Finally, I took a photo of the thumbprint and cropped it down to the required `1:3` aspect ratio.

## Fill application form

I filled the application form online at [ociservices.gov.in/onlineOCI](https://ociservices.gov.in/onlineOCI).

The documentation was not very clear as to whether either my wife's Indian passport or my OCI could be used to meet the OCI eligibility criteria. I decided to base the application on my wife's Indian passport. Therefore, she was the one who signed the forms and the photocopies of the supporting documents.

## Upload supporting documents

I uploaded the following documents. I had to fill out one additional form [Undertaking by OCI applicant regarding Indian voter ID, etc.](https://www.hcilondon.gov.in/docs/174866933730052025_Voter_ID_undertaking.pdf), which I only found out at the appointment.

## Book and attend the appointment at VFS

I booked the appointment online via hcilondon.gov.in/appointment and got one within just a few days. My first appointment was a disaster because I didn't have an apostilled birth certificate. So, I had to wait until the birth certificate was apostilled.

I booked the second appointment online via hcilondon.gov.in/appointment and got one within just a few days. I had to take the appointment confirmation letter and all original documents with me. There was only a short wait of about 15 minutes for the appointment.

However, I was then told that I needed to print out the following missing documents and also attach them to the online application. This wasn't obvious to me from the instructions: [HCI - OCI renewal 18.11.2021](https://www.hcilondon.gov.in/docs/1637214490OCIRenewal18112021.pdf).

1. Mother's UK visa status page
2. Mother's UK visa share code
3. [Undertaking by OCI applicant regarding Indian voter ID, etc.](https://www.hcilondon.gov.in/docs/174866933730052025_Voter_ID_undertaking.pdf)

Fortunately, they were happy for me to do this at the appointment. I got hold of and uploaded the documents on my phone. I then had to queue to use a computer (they only had two) to take printouts. I had to wait nearly an hour as there were other applicants in front of me trying to prepare photos and thumbprints on Paint, and the computers themselves were ancient, slow and error-prone. I paid £3 for internet use and printouts.

I had brought two pre-paid special delivery envelopes with me, which could be used to deliver the birth certificate and the OCI card back to me. However, they said I needed to provide a hardback envelope for the birth certificate. So, I just opted to pay extra for their courier charges - £12.50 each. So, my special delivery envelopes were wasted.

The total charge was £257.44 with the following breakdown:
- £215 + £3 HCI charges
- £12.50 courier charge for the birth certificate
- £12.50 courier charge for the OCI card
- £6.20 VFS service charge
- £1.77 SMS fee
- £6.57 VAT

Towards the end, they said that the child's photo background should be solid white (ours had the bedsheet white) and recommended removing it digitally and reuploading the same day. I used [Photoroom](https://www.photoroom.com/tools/background-remove) to edit the background.

## Conclusion

I received the OCI card less than a month after the appointment, and I'm so glad that whole thing is behind me, as it was quite stressful! We're now looking forward to our visit to India!

I hope this helps anyone else who is in a similar situation. Feel free to comment or ask any questions in the comments section below.

Good luck!
