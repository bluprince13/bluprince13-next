I am a British citizen with an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card. My wife is an Indian citizen with a UK spouse visa. In 2025, our first child was born in the UK with British citizenship. We planned to take him to India after he was 6 months old to see the rest of our family.

I first considered a tourist e-visa for its convenience, but at £127 [[HCI - visa fee structure](https://www.hcilondon.gov.in/page/visa-fee-structure/)], it felt expensive for a single trip. An OCI application, while costing more upfront at £215, offers lifetime visa-free travel to India and only needs re-issuance when a new passport is issued after the age of 20 [[HCI - OCI renewal 18.11.2021](https://www.hcilondon.gov.in/docs/1637214490OCIRenewal18112021.pdf)]. The OCI is the more prudent long-term choice, despite the hassle of attending an appointment and 1-2 months process time.

In this article, I describe my experience applying for my child's OCI when he was  3 months old, and I hope it helps other parents going through the same process.

## Timeline

Here is a timeline of the events. In particular, note that you need to legalise the child's UK birth certificate before applying for OCI. Therefore, allow for a month before you can submit the OCI application.

## Preparation

### Apostille on UK birth Certificate

I had to go to the VFS appointment twice, because the 1st time I didn't have an apostilled birth certificate and VFS refused to submit the application. The guidance was changed in June 2025, and it is now mandatory to have an apostille.

The process is pretty straightforward:

- **Go to**: [gov.uk - Get your document legalised
](https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised/apply-for-legalisation)
- **Process**: Fill out the online form, print the cover sheet, and mail it with the original birth certificate. I used a hardback envelope for protection, and thankfully it was returned in one too.
- **Cost**: £45 + £5.50 courier fee
- **Time**: They say ~15 working days. In my case, it took 11 days total.

The apostille is a separate certificate attached to the back of the original. It can also be verified online at [verifyapostille.service.gov.uk](https://www.verifyapostille.service.gov.uk)

### Prepare 2"x2" photo

You can see the official requirements for the photo here: [Requirement of photograph for OCI Registration](https://ociservices.gov.in/Photo-Spec-FINAL.pdf). It allows for some flexibility for babies and children under 10 years old.

Getting a good photo was hard!

1. **Setup**: We placed our son in his cot on a white bedsheet during the day for good natural light.
2. **Photoshoot**: Using my camera (a good mobile phone would also work), we took numerous photos to get one with his eyes open, looking towards the camera with a neutral expression.
3. **Editing**: I used [darktable](https://www.darktable.org/) (which is not very easy to use, but you can use any tool you feel comfortable with) to crop the photo to the required 2"x2" size, ensuring his face took up about 80% of the frame. The VFS staff mentioned a preference for a solid white background, so I used [Photoroom](https://www.photoroom.com/tools/background-remover) to replace the bedsheet with a solid white background.
4. **Printing**: I ordered six 2"x2" copies from [OddPrints](https://www.oddprints.com/) for just under £5. You only need to submit two physical copies at the appointment though.

### Prepare thumbprint photo

1. **Tool**: We bought a simple fingerprint ink pad from Amazon.
2. **Execution**: We waited until our son was fast asleep. We gently but firmly pressed his thumb onto the ink pad and then onto a folded (which makes it easier to hold) A4 sheet of paper. We made several impressions to choose the best one.
3. **Cleanup**: We cleaned his thumb immediately with wet cotton wool. It goes away easily. He slept through the whole thing!
4. **Digitising**: I took a clear photo of the best thumbprint and cropped it to the required `1:3` aspect ratio for the online application upload.

## Application process

### Fill online form

I filled the application form at [ociservices.gov.in/onlineOCI](https://ociservices.gov.in/onlineOCI).

The documentation was unclear on whether to base the application on my wife's Indian passport or my OCI card. I decided to use my wife's Indian passport which felt more direct. Consequently, my wife (the Indian citizen parent) signed the forms and self-attested (signed and dated) the supporting documents.

### Upload supporting documents

I uploaded the following documents. Note that I had to print and upload one additional form [Undertaking by OCI applicant regarding Indian voter ID, etc.](https://www.hcilondon.gov.in/docs/174866933730052025_Voter_ID_undertaking.pdf), which I only found out about at the appointment.

### Book and attend the appointment at VFS

I booked the appointment online via [hcilondon.gov.in/appointment](https://hcilondon.gov.in/appointment) and got one within just a few days. My first appointment was a disaster because I didn't have an apostilled birth certificate. So, I had to wait until the birth certificate was apostilled. There was only a short wait of about 15 minutes at the appointment.

**Document checklist**
1. Appointment confirmation page
2. Two physical 2"x2" photographs
3. An authorisation letter from my wife, since I was the only one attending the appointment
4. Original documents corresponding to documents uploaded online
5. Self-attested copies of documents uploaded online
6. Two pre-paid special delivery envelopes (although they were not used and I ended up paying extra for VFS courier charges)

At the appointment, I was asked to upload and print out the following missing documents. This wasn't obvious to me from the instructions: [HCI - OCI renewal 18.11.2021](https://www.hcilondon.gov.in/docs/1637214490OCIRenewal18112021.pdf), so I'm just highlighting it here:
1. Mother's UK visa status page
2. Mother's UK visa share code
3. [Undertaking by OCI applicant regarding Indian voter ID, etc.](https://www.hcilondon.gov.in/docs/174866933730052025_Voter_ID_undertaking.pdf)

Fortunately, they were happy for me to do this at the appointment. I got hold of and uploaded the documents on my phone. I then had to queue to use a computer (they only had two) to take printouts. I had to wait nearly an hour as there were other applicants in front of me trying to prepare photos and thumbprints on Paint, and the computers themselves were ancient, slow and error-prone. I paid £3 for the privilege /s.

I had brought two pre-paid special delivery envelopes with me, which could be used to deliver the birth certificate and the OCI card back to me. However, they said I needed to provide a hardback envelope, not a special delivery envelope for the birth certificate. In the interest of time, I decided to pay extra for their courier charges - £12.50 each. My special delivery envelopes were wasted.

After submitting the applciation, they said that the child's photo background should ideally be solid white (ours had the bedsheet as background) and recommended removing it digitally and reuploading the same day. I used [Photoroom](https://www.photoroom.com/tools/background-remove) to edit the background.

### Cost summary

The total charge was £257.44 with the following breakdown:
- £215 + £3 HCI charges
- £12.50 courier charge for the birth certificate
- £12.50 courier charge for the OCI card
- £6.20 VFS service charge
- £1.77 SMS fee
- £6.57 VAT

## Conclusion

I received the OCI card less than a month after the appointment, and I'm so glad that whole thing is behind me, as it was quite stressful! We're now eagerly looking forward to our visit to India!

I hope this helps anyone else who is in a similar situation. Feel free to comment or ask any questions in the comments section below.

Good luck!
