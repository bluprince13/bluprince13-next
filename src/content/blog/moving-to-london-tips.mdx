My sister recently moved to London from India which prompted to write up a list
of tips for her. Thought I'd share them on my blog. Let me know if I have missed
anything out in the comments below!

## Set up a bank account and get a debit card

This should be your number one priority. You need a bank account and a debit
card to live here.

There are lots of traditional banks in the UK like HSBC, but in my experience,
these have very outdated apps and poor customer service. I particularly hate it
when they ask me to come into a branch for something simple. I recommend signing
up with one of the newer digital banks. Unlike traditional banks, these don't
have their own branches. They are all based on mobile apps, i.e., you create an
account on an app, and you use the app to order a debit card, view transactions,
get statemnents, contact customer service etc. You can stil use free ATMs to
withdraw cash if you really need to, although I can't remember the last time I
used an ATM.

The Times has a good
[guide to online banks for international students](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/advice/guide-online-banks-international-students).
However, here are my personal recommendations along with referral links which
should give you some benefit.

I personally use [Monzo](https://join.monzo.com/c/26v7nqh) as my primary bank
account. I have also heard good things about
[Starling](https://www.starlingbank.com/referral?code=bQjtXl).

I also use [Revolut](https://revolut.com/referral/vipin7o8) for its
multi-currency bank accounts. Some of my friends use Revolut so it's easier to
transact with them via Revolut than Monzo.

I also have a [Wise account](https://wise.com/invite/i/vipina2) for both sending
and receiving international transfers, althought I rarely use it these days
because
[Monzo uses Wise for international transfers](https://monzo.com/blog/new-international-transfers/)
automatically. If you have parents sending you money from your home country, it
might be cheaper and easier for them to use a Wise account however.

## Get a mobile SIM plan

You will need a mobile phone and a SIM plan. I recommend buying the phone
outright and then getting a cheap SIM only plan. Network coverage and price
should be your main criteria for choosing between network providers.

Network coverage varies widely across the UK. For example,
[Three](https://www.three.co.uk/) worked well for me in Bath where I was a
student. However, in East London where I live now, it is awful. You can check
the
[mobile availability for your postcode](https://checker.ofcom.org.uk/en-gb/mobile-coverage),
however, I think it's best to ask people in the area how good their coverage is
or try various SIMs before committing to one.

Use [Uswitch](https://www.uswitch.com/mobiles/) to find a cheap deal. I
currently use [Lebara](https://www.lebara.co.uk/) 15 GB/month at Â£6.95 per
month.

## Get an oyster card and link it to a rail card

In London you can just use your contactless bank card to pay for trains and
buses. However, it's cheaper to use an
[Oyster card](https://oyster.tfl.gov.uk/oyster) linked to a
[rail card](https://www.thetrainline.com/trains/great-britain/railcards). The
railcard gives you 1/3rd off train travel across the UK. By linking the rail
card to the Oyster card, you get the discount on the London Underground too. :)

 href="https://www.thetrainline.com/trains/great-britain/railcards"
/>

Here are the steps:

1. Order an Oyster card online.
2. Order a rail card online. If you are a student aged 16-25, look for discounts
   on the [16-25 railcard](https://www.16-25railcard.co.uk/) on Google to save a
   bit more.
3. Link your Oyster card to your rail card. Simply take your Oyster card and
   valid Railcard to a London Underground station and ask a member of staff to
   set the discount for you.

Finally, set up
[auto top-up on your Oyster card](https://oyster.tfl.gov.uk/oyster/link/sso/0002.do),
so you don't ever have to worry about it running out.

## Use Citymapper to get around London, don't use Google Maps

[Citymapper](https://citymapper.com/) is my go-to app for planning travel around
London. Citymapper is particularly good at accouting for delays and disruptions.
If a line is not operating, it won't even show it to you within the options.
This means you don't have to keep an eye on the
[TFL status updates](https://tfl.gov.uk/tube-dlr-overground/status/).

## Register with a General Practitioner (GP) and a NHS dentist

In the UK, you can't just go to a hospital and see any doctor you want. You have
to go via a General Practitioiner or GP that you're registered with. You should
[register with a GP surgery](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/gps/how-to-register-with-a-gp-surgery/)
early. Don't wait till you're sick.

You also have to register separately with a NHS dentist. Note that you do need
to
[pay for NHS dental treatment](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/dentists/dental-costs/how-much-will-i-pay-for-nhs-dental-treatment/).
It might be very difficult to find a dentist that will take you on as an NHS
patient. Waiting lists could be months/years long. So, it's worth starting your
search early rather than waiting until you have tooth ache.

Locate your nearest
[Accident and emergency services](https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/other-services/Accident-and-emergency-services/LocationSearch/428)
if you need urgent medical attention but it's not a life-threatening situation.

Read up on when to call 111, 999, go to A&E etc.
[here](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/urgent-and-emergency-care-services/).

It's also worth being aware that the health service in the UK is kind of poor.
Whilst it's free, access to it is very limited. In my experience, unless you're
at risk of dying, the doctor won't refer you to the hospital. I exaggerate, but
only slightly. Waiting times also tend to be quite bad. For example, I have
waited >3 months for a physio appointment. In fact, I tend to get most of my health
checks done back home in India where access to health care is a lot better.

## Get a Unidays account and Totum student card to make use of student discounts

There are lots of student discounts available in London. In particular I
recommend getting a [Unidays](https://www.unidays.com/uk) account and a
[Totum student card](https://www.totum.com/). Before you buy anything online or
in-shop, it's worth checking if you can get a student discount first.

I particularly miss the
[Apple Store education pricing](https://www.apple.com/uk-edu/shop/education-pricing).

## Get a credit card so you can start building credit history

When I first arrived in the UK and applied for a mobile phone contract, I was
surprised to get rejected on the basis of a failed credit check. I had never
borrowed money in my life, let alone defaulted on payments. How could it be?

A really strange thing about the UK is that it is difficult to pass credit
checks unless you have a credit history. In other words, you have to borrow
money to build a credit history, in order to borrow money. The best way to build
a credit history is to get a credit card and do your daily spending on it. As
long as you pay off the balance every month you will never pay any charges on
it. If you set up a
[direct debit](https://www.directdebit.co.uk/direct-debit-explained/what-is-direct-debit/)
for that credit card, then the monthly payment will be automatically deducted
from your bank account. Easy peasy!

I use an
[American Express Platinum Cashback Everyday Credit Card](https://americanexpress.com/en-gb/referral/vIPINAdpLG?XL=MIANS)
which also gives you 0.5% cashback. However, you're unlikely to get it if you
have no credit history.

I recommend using
[MoneySavingExpert's](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/credit-cards/) guide and
credit card eligibility calculator to work out which might be the best credit
card for you.

## Conclusion

That's all. All the best with your move to London and hope you have a blast.
