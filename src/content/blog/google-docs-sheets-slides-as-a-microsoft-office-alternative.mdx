Recently I was helping my father get up and running with his new Mac. He wanted
me to install Microsoft Office apps for him. Rather than pay Â£59.99 for a
[Microsoft Office subscription](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/buy/compare-all-microsoft-365-products),
I set up Google [Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/),
[Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/), and
[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation) for him instead. I am not sure
how they compare as I don't use any of the tools myself. However,
[according to Lifewire](https://www.lifewire.com/google-docs-vs-microsoft-word-5112811),
the Google apps should be more than enough for the average user.

The Google apps being web apps, it takes a bit of effort to setup offline
editing. In this article, I provide setup instructions so that you can easily
access and edit your files even when you're offline. These instrucitons should
work for Windows too.

- Install [Backup and Sync](https://www.google.com/drive/download/) app. It
  creates a `Google Drive` folder in your sidebar, making it easy to access your
  files. It also allows you to backup folders on your laptop to Google Drive,
  but you can skip past that unless you want to use that feature too.

- Install
  [Application Launcher For Drive](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/application-launcher-for/lmjegmlicamnimmfhcmpkclmigmmcbeh/)
  Chrome extension. It allows you to open Google Drive files with `gsheet`,
  `gslides` and `gdoc` file extensions directly in the Chrome browser.
