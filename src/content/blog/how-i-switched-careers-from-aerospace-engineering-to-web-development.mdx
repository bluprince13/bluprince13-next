In my
[previous article](/blog/why-i-switched-careers-from-aerospace-engineering-to-web-development),
I explained my motivation for leaving Engineering to become a web developer. In
this article, I focus on how I went about achieving that goal. I describe the
challenges I faced, particularly as an immigrant in the UK. I hope this helps
readers looking to make a similar career transition.

## My preparation to be a web developer began long before I wanted to be one.

Towards the end of 2016, I was nearing the end of the graduate scheme at a
leading Aerospace Engineering company. I was looking for a three-month
attachment where I’d have an opportunity to code and luckily found a data
parsing task for the Aeroacoustics team. I hurriedly taught myself Python and
after a couple of failed iterations, had a working prototype ready. I learnt
a ton! This experience inspired me, more than a year later, to write about
[parsing text with Python](https://www.vipinajayakumar.com/parsing-text-with-python/)
and
[getting started with Python](https://www.vipinajayakumar.com/getting-started-with-python.html).

I then joined the Aeroacoustics team as a work-stream lead. I spent about half
my time doing project management - not something that excited me. However, I
also had fun, analysing noise data using Python. For a whole year, I focused on
developing my Python and data analysis skills. I created my own Python package
to make my work easier. The package grew to thousands of lines of code. 😱 I
made lots of rookie mistakes such as ignoring the
[single-responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle)
and not writing any tests. Pain was had, and lessons were learnt.

Towards the end of 2017, I attended PyCon UK and boy, was it an eye-opener! I
had barely scratched the surface, and there was so much more to learn. The
conference got me interested in blogging about tech. I created a new blog with a
first entry about
[PyCon UK 2017](https://www.vipinajayakumar.com/pycon-uk-2017/).

The conference also inspired me to get involved with the developer community at
my workplace. I created a
[Yammer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/yammer/yammer-overview)
group at work for Python developers. I also started a monthly Python lecture
series at work. I invited developers at my company to prepare talks. I handled
all the advertisement, send out meeting invites and handled the
recording/publishing. I even delivered a few talks myself. I met a lot of
inspiring programmers via that Yammer group. By the time I left, the group had
grown to some 600 members.

I got interested in web development, having been inspired to check out
[React](https://reactjs.org/) by one of my colleagues. My learning approach for
new technologies is to watch courses, e.g., on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/),
and then find a personal project to experiment with the technology and deepen my
understanding. As one of my first projects, I made a website for the Python
lecture series. It was just a simple table of previous lectures with links to
slides and recordings. Following that, I made another app with a navigation bar
and videos to explain a certain workflow to employees.

All this while, switching careers is not something I planned to do. I loved (and
still do) love Engineering. However, I was preparing for that eventual
transition by learning software development fundamentals. The experiences I
described above became useful material for my CV and interviews as well.

## Around mid-2018, I started applying for jobs outside my company.

This was a year and a half after I first started learning Python.
[LinkedIn jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs) was the only job listings site I
used. I could see that the big tech companies were advertising on LinkedIn, and
I also liked LinkedIn’s clean UI. I set up an email alert for new jobs that
matched keywords like `Web development`, `Front-end` etc. so that I could apply
for jobs as soon as they were posted.

At first, I didn’t advertise the fact that I needed a visa to recruiters. I
waited until they asked me about it because I was keen to get some interview
experience. However, nearly every company was rejecting me solely because of
this one factor. Therefore, I stopped applying to small companies. Most of them
are either not on the
[register of sponsors](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-licensed-sponsors-workers)
or unlikely to sponsor visas due to the financial and bureaucratic burden. To be
completely transparent, I added the following statement on my CV:

> I require sponsorship to apply for a Tier 2 (General) visa to work in the UK.

## I developed and showcased my web development skills.

Once I decided to apply externally, I thought it’d be nice to have something to
show on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/bluprince13). I stopped investing
my own time into side projects at work. I spent more and more time doing courses
on web development and working on personal coding projects. I also made some
sacrifices. I dropped nearly all my hobbies, side-projects and volunteering.
I became even more of a social recluse. I spent most evenings and weekends
studying and coding. In a typical week, I would spend about 40 hours at work,
and then another 10-20 hours learning/coding/applying for jobs at home. 😫

I made two apps:
[renting vs. buying a house](https://bluprince13.com/apps/renting-vs-buying) and
[ssh-key-manager](https://github.com/bluprince13/ssh-key-manager). I also wrote
on [my blog](https://www.vipinajayakumar.com). In particular, I wrote about the
[standard error of the mean](https://www.vipinajayakumar.com/standard-error-of-the-mean.html)
and the
[statistical t-test used to compare sample means](https://www.vipinajayakumar.com/an-interactive-explanation-of-the-statistical-t-test-used-to-compare-sample-means.html).
These were interactive articles, made possible via
[Observable](https://observablehq.com/).

Web development is tough to learn. It’s such a rapidly developing field that
it’s hard for a beginner to know where to start. I wrote an article on
[getting started with JavaScript](https://www.vipinajayakumar.com/getting-started-with-javascript.html)
based on my experience of teaching it to myself.

## I prepared for interviews.

There are generally two parts to an interview.

- Values interview
- Coding interview

### Values interview

I put the values one first because it’s hard to teach adults good values. It’s a
lot easier to teach technical skills. For example: putting the customer first,
treating colleagues respectfully, being open to feedback, treating work as fun.
Good companies know their core values, and they make a conscious effort to hire
people who have a similar set of values. Employees reinforce these values in
each other on a day-to-day basis as well. Check out the values for the following
companies:

- [Spotify](https://hrblog.spotify.com/2016/09/02/spotifys-core-values/)
- [Amazon](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles)
- [Google](https://www.google.com/about/philosophy.html)
- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/careers/facebook-life/)

I usually prepare for a values interview by studying the values of the company.
Luckily for me, most big tech companies have values that I easily identify with.
I prepare answers to questions around those core values, drawing on my
experiences. I use the
[STAR technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_task,_action,_result)
to tell the story properly.

I write down my answers in a git repo which allows me to refine them over time
and reuse content for interviews with other companies. Unfortunately, this is a
private repo, but here’s an example.

_Amazon Principle 10 - Learn and Be Curious. Leaders are never done learning and
always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and
act to explore them._

- **Situation**. Programming is something I’m passionate about, and I naturally
  spend a lot of time learning and developing this skill. Planning, on the other
  hand, is a skill that’s taken me significant effort to develop. At one point,
  my company made a push for better planning.
- **Task**. As part of this, my manager wanted me to draw network diagrams for
  every task I led. At first, I wasn’t sure these diagrams would be all that
  value-adding, but I kept an open mind. I could have drawn up a few diagrams
  just to satisfy my manager, but I wanted to give it my best effort.
- **Action**. I found it difficult to draw the diagrams on paper / PowerPoint. I
  could never get them right the first time! I tried a tool called
  [yEd](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed) but found the interface difficult.
  A friend of mine at work taught me how to make the most out of yEd. Using yEd,
  I was able to create high-quality network diagrams. I took the time to get
  them right by reviewing them with teammates.
- **Result**. I was able to plan and optimise even really complex activities,
  such as an aircraft engine noise test that takes months of coordinated effort,
  using my diagrams. In reviews with seniors, I could use my diagrams to
  communicate better, identify bottlenecks and ask for help. I got addicted to
  drawing network diagrams and planning. I even did presentations on yEd for the
  wider team.

For the bigger companies, I looked at blogs or YouTube videos to help prepare
for their interviews. For example,
[interviewgenie](https://interviewgenie.com/blog-1/category/Amazon+interviews)
is an amazing resource to help prepare for Amazon interviews. I also practised
my answers with friends. It not only helps with flow and confidence, but good
friends will also tell you when your answer falls flat. 👎

I want to stress that preparing for the values interview isn’t just about the
one or two weeks of preparation. I was drawing from four years of work
experience for my answers.

For me, the values interview feels like the easy part. I wouldn’t apply to a
company whose values didn’t appeal to me anyway. I care about values so much
that I even have [my own list of values](https://bluprince13.com/values).

### Coding interview

```python
for fizzbuzz in range(51):
    if fizzbuzz % 3 == 0 and fizzbuzz % 5 == 0:
        print("fizzbuzz")
        continue
    elif fizzbuzz % 3 == 0:
        print("fizz")
        continue
    elif fizzbuzz % 5 == 0:
        print("buzz")
        continue
    print(fizzbuzz)
```

I have mixed feelings regarding the coding interview. On the one hand, problems
I face day-to-day as a software developer have little relation with typical
coding interview problems. Yet, it is still a useful tool to understand the
problem-solving ability of a person.

I also learnt that I had to prepare for it specifically. Learning React, for
example, will not help you pass a coding interview. I do all of my coding
interview preparation in
[bluprince13/coding-interview-prep](https://github.com/bluprince13/coding-interview-prep).
In the README, I also provide some guidance on preparing for it.

## I had two on-site interviews.

### My first on-site

<Figure src="/blog/how-i-switched-careers-from-aerospace-engineering-to-web-development/assets/spotify.png" />

In Feb 2020, I had my first on-site with Spotify, a company that I adored. They
have five core values, and one of them is
`We’re playful: We don’t take ourselves too seriously`. How cool is that? 🤘

<Figure

/>

The on-site consisted of the following:

- Coding interview with two developers
- Values interview with two managers
- Problem-solving interview with two developers

Here are some self-reflective notes I made following the on-site:

- Not fluent enough in JS for the live coding interview. Need to improve. I
  should also use Python instead in future interviews.
- Completely messed up the whiteboard interview. Didn’t think of creating my own
  class!
- Bad handwriting. The interviewers probably couldn’t read my scribbles well.
- Needed too much help from the interviewers.
- Values interview - no issues, felt confident.

I was heartbroken when Spotify rejected me. 😭 I did get some feedback from the
recruiter. My interviewers thought that I was a great fit with the company’s
culture. However, they felt that my lack of experience within a software
development team was too much of a risk. My recruiter recommended me to get a
few months of experience elsewhere and try again with Spotify.

The feedback was fair. However, I also knew it’d be impossible for me to find a
`practice job` at a smaller company as an immigrant. I was in a catch-22. Big
companies wanted someone with experience. Small companies couldn’t sponsor my
visa. 🤷‍♂️

Rejection after rejection, I sank into depression for a few months. Around the
same time, I also had to deal with
[sciatica](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sciatica/) - searing pain in my lower
back and right leg. I couldn’t walk nor sleep well. Work was also stressful.
Mental health-wise, I felt like I was near breaking point. I leaned on my
friends and family for support. Encouraged by a friend, I signed up for a few
counselling sessions which thankfully gave me some relief.

### My second on-site

<Figure src="/blog/how-i-switched-careers-from-aerospace-engineering-to-web-development/assets/amazon.png" />

By October 2019, nearly eight months after my first on-site with Spotify, I was
beginning to think that maybe it was time to give up. I had probably had some
150 rejections by then. It might be better to wait for my UK residency a year
later before carrying on with the job search. Then, like a miracle, I got a
chance to interview with Amazon Prime Video. Amazon is one of my favourite
companies. As a consumer, I don’t trust any other company half as much as I
trust Amazon. I was excited about potentially working for them, but worried
about my chances.

I had four interviews in one day, each with a single interviewer. Each
interviewer tested me on both coding and values.

I was a lot better prepared for this interview. I had learnt from my failures
with Spotify and telephone/video interviews with other companies. On 9th October
2019, my recruiter called me and informed me that I had passed. It was, without
a doubt, the happiest day of my life.

## Reflections

One of the things I got right was to start applying from the get-go. I didn’t
wait to feel like I was ready like I see some of my friends do. I developed my
skills alongside actively applying for jobs. Whilst it was painful and
depressing to get rejected, I learnt a lot from each failed interview, such as
what skills to improve/develop. For example, seeing so many full-stack jobs out
there, I started doing courses on backend development, databases, and cloud
infrastructure. Even though I was initially only looking for a front-end
developer role, I ended up becoming a full-stack developer instead.

I feel so much anger for the way that immigrants are treated. Immigration
policies are legally mandated racism. Not that I’m ungrateful. I feel privileged
to have had such unique opportunities as an immigrant in the UK. However,
limiting immigrants’ freedom to change jobs and trapping them in a position
feels inhumane. Something needs to change.

I had a horrible experience with independent recruiters that match jobs with
candidates. I was just a product for them, not the customer. I had much
better results in applying to companies directly.

I had very little to show on my
[GitHub profile](https://github.com/bluprince13). I wish I had spent more time
doing projects than just passively learning.

Looking back, I wish I had worked a lot harder. I wasted so much time being
depressed and feeling sorry for myself. However, as much as I’d like to be
one, I know that I’m not a machine. As a human, sometimes it’s okay not to be
okay. 👌

## Conclusion

Phew! I know this was long but, hopefully, this gives you a comprehensive enough
view. If you have any questions, please comment below, and I will happily answer
them. Good luck with your job search! I hope you find something that makes you
happy. 😃
