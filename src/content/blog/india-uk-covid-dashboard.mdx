It's been nearly two years now since I've been back home to India. ðŸ˜­ I've been
keeping an eye on the Covid situation in both India and the UK. Recently, I
created a dashboard using [Observable](https://observablehq.com/) which I felt
like sharing. For the source code and references to the data sources I used,
please check out my
[Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/@bluprince13/india-uk-covid-dashboard).
