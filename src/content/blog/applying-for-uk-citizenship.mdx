Back in 2010, I first arrived in the UK, to do my degree. Eleven years passed by
so quickly, and I recently applied for and became a UK citizen. It was a bit of
a nerve-wracking experience, mostly because there aren't many people you can
talk to about it and at
[£1330](https://www.gov.uk/apply-citizenship-indefinite-leave-to-remain), it is
expensive! In this article, I describe my experience of applying for UK
citizenship. This is just my personal experience. Please rely on the
[official guidance](https://www.gov.uk/apply-citizenship-indefinite-leave-to-remain/how-to-apply)
if you are applying for it.

## Timeline

<Alert severity="info">
 There was a 34-day delay after I got my citizenship ceremony invitation because
 I was in India at the time and I had to wait until I was back in the UK before
 I could request to book my citizenship ceremony.

## Fill in the online application form

The form itself took a couple of days of effort to fill. Travel history was easy
because I already had prepared it for my ILR application the year before. The
hardest bit to fill in were details about previous UK immigration applications.
I had to search through emails from years ago. I didn't find application
reference numbers or dates for all of them, but that was okay because those
fields were optional. Overall, the citizenship application didn't feel as
difficult as the ILR application.

When I applied, it gave me some further actions (see
[what it looked like for me](/blog/applying-for-uk-citizenship/assets/citizenship-application-further-actions.png)).

## Book a biometrics appointment

The earliest available appointments cost about £100 or more if I recall
correctly. The only free biometrics appointments I could find were a month away.
According to [UKVCAS FAQ](https://www.ukvcas.co.uk/faq),
`appointments are released daily, 28 days in advance`. As soon as I booked the
appointment, I was allowed to upload my supporting documents.

## Upload supporting documents

I uploaded the following documents to UKVCAS (see
[what it looked like for me](/blog/applying-for-uk-citizenship/assets/ukvcas-docs-upload.png)).
It required them to be grouped by `type` - so I had to guess which type to put
them under. I used my ILR to meet two of the requirements. I also was not sure
what to submit as proof of living in the UK for 5 years. I submitted as many
documents as I could think of. Fortunately, the document checking service I had
paid for confirmed that everything was in order.

## Biometrics appointment

This took about ten minutes at most. They only wanted to scan my current
passport as I had uploaded all my other supporting documents already.

## Citizenship ceremony

My ceremony was at [Redbridge Town Hall](https://goo.gl/maps/SaUCGy4594BZF7Z69).
When I got there, I queued up with ten or so other attendees. Due to Covid none
of us was allowed to bring any guests with us. I had to show an id proof and the
email inviting me to the ceremony before I could get seated. A lady explained
the process to all of us, following which each of us had to stand up and read
the
[affirmation (or oath) of allegiance and the pledge](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/british-citizenship-successful-applicants/citizenship-ceremonies-guidance-notes-english-and-welsh).
Following this, we were given a few minutes to take photos of ourselves in front
of a picture of the Queen. It took about 45 minutes in all.

Check out the official guidance about
[what will happen at the ceremony](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/british-citizenship-successful-applicants/citizenship-ceremonies-guidance-notes-english-and-welsh#what-will-happen-at-the-ceremony).

The two main things I was required to do following the ceremony were:

- [Cut the ILR biometric card and return it via post](https://www.gov.uk/apply-citizenship-indefinite-leave-to-remain/after-you-get-your-certificate)
- [Re-register to vote as a British citizen](https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote)

## Applying for a British passport

It's fairly straightforward to
[apply for the British passport](https://www.gov.uk/apply-renew-passport)
online. I opted for the 50-page frequent traveller passport which
[costs £85.50](https://www.gov.uk/passport-fees).

Since this was my first passport application, I was also required to post my
current passport and my certificate of naturalisation to the passport office.
One thing I found annoying was that it took them three weeks to update the
website to say they had received my documents.

## Conclusion

For all of my previous VISA applications, I had a company lawyer supporting me.
However, for my citizenship, I had to apply on my own. It was quite stressful
not to have a qualified person to check my application or clarify my questions.
Luckily, I was able to consult a friend of mine who had applied recently. I also
found a
[few helpful videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=UK+citizenship+application).

It felt pretty good to get my British citizenship after such a long wait. If
you're pursuing British citizenship, I hope my article was of some use to you.
Good luck!

In my case, as I'm Indian, I sadly also have to
[surrender my Indian passport](https://www.hcilondon.gov.in/page/surrender-of-indian-passport/)
and apply for an [OCI card](https://www.hcilondon.gov.in/page/oci-card/) which
will allow me to travel to India freely.
