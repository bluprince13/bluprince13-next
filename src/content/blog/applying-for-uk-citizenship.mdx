Back in 2010, I first arrived in the UK, to do my degree. Eleven years passed by
so quickly, and I recently applied for and became a UK citizen. It was a bit of
nervewracking experience, mostly because there aren't many people you can talk
to about it. In this article, I describe my experience of applying for UK
citizenship. This is just my personal experience, and you shouldn't expect your
experience to be the same.

## Overall experience

For all of my previous VISA applications, I had a company lawyer supporting me.
However, for my citizenship, I had to apply on my own. It was quite stressful
not to have a qualified person to check my application or to clarify my
questions. I consulted a friend of mine who had applied recently. I also found a
[few videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=UK+citizenship+application).

### Filling in the online application form

The form itself took a few days of effort to fill. Travel history was easy
because I already had prepared it for my ILR application the year before. The
hardest bit to fill were details about previous UK immigration applications. I
had to search through emails from years ago. I didn't find application reference
numbers for all of them or dates for all of them, but that was okay because
those fields were optional. Overall, it didn't feel as difficult as the ILR
application.

### Book biometrics appointment

The only free biometrics appointments I could find were nearly a month away.
According to [UKVCAS FAQ](https://www.ukvcas.co.uk/faq),
`appointments are released daily, 28 days in advance`.

### Supporting documents

Specifically for my case, I had to provide the following documents.

<Table
 columns={[
  { name: 'Requirement', key: 'req' },
  { name: 'What I submitted', key: 'submission' }
 ]}
 rows={[
  {
   req: 'Passport',
   submission: 'Scan of my current passport (front and back)'
  },
  {
   req: 'Proof of living in the UK for 5 years',
   submission: `Scans of all pages for my current and previous passport
    Scans of P60s and reference letters from my employers (just to be safe)`
  },
  {
   req: 'Proof of freedom from immigration time restrictions',
   submission: 'Scan of ILR'
  },
  {
   req: 'Degree certificate to prove level of English',
   submission: 'Scan of my University certificate'
  },
  {
   req: 'Two Referee declarations',
   submission: 'Scan of referee letters from two of my friends'
  },
  {
   req: 'Current Biometric Residence Permit',
   submission: 'Scan of ILR'
  }
 ]}
