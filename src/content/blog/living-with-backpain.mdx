In 2019, I had an accident at my gym. I had a
[slipped disc](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/slipped-disc/) injury while doing
squats. Since then I've had varying levels of back pain, including
[sciatica](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sciatica/) for a brief period, and have
had to learn to live with it. Along the way, I've picked up some techniques and
products for managing my pain, which I'd like to share in this article.

PS - This article isn't medical advice, just my personal experience. You should
see a doctor for medical advice.

## Osteopathy treatment

[Osteopathy](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/osteopathy) is "a way of detecting,
treating and preventing health problems by moving, stretching and massaging a
person's muscles and joints". It's a bit more hands on than phsyiotheraphy. When
I began my treatment, I saw significant benefits. It even allowed me to back
into running after a two year break from it since my injury. I have a half hour
therapy session every fortnight to keep my backpain and stiffness in check.

## Regular excercise

My backpain usually gets worse when I take a break from gym. I go to the gym
about three days a week. I'm careful not to do excercises that exert a
significant compressive load on my lower back. I also don't do squats or
deadlifts anymore because I'm genuinely scared to injure my back again. However,
I do work out my back. Specifically, the days that I work my core or back
muscles seem to help the most.

Following excercise or my osteopathy treatment, I use an ice pack for twenty
minutes to reduce inflammation.

## Stretching

The other thing that really helps is doing stretches. My favourite stretch is
the knee to opposite shoulder stretch.

## Sleeping comfortably

Did you know that there are `right` and `wrong` ways to sleep? I didn't until I
saw this video. I used to love laying on my stomach, but since my injury I find
it a lot easier lying on my back. I also use pillows to raise my legs as shown
in the video. Sometimes, especially if I've had a bad day, I do find myself
laying on my stomach, but as soon as I realise my mistake, I correct myself.

I highly recommend the Recci Memory Foam Mattress. I used to have backpain when
I wake up until I got this. My osteopath recommended getting a mattress topper
and I'm glad I listened to her! I also use a Misiki Orthopedic Pillow which
helps me maintain my sleeping position better than a normal pillow.

## Sit stand desk

In my office, I used to have a sit stand desk. However, when quarantine and the
work from home period began, I bought myself a simple table from Ikea. I debated
getting myself a sit-stand desk, but delayed it because I knew it'd be a hassle
when it came to moving houses in the future. A year later, still working from
home, I thought I'd get one. I'm really happy with this desk, and the mat that I
bought alongside.

## Pain relief ointments

I started using Biofreeze recently after a friend recommended it to me. It's
great for when I can't be asked to put the icepack on, and need some pain relief
after sitting down for too long etc.

## Conclusion

That's all folks. I'm still trying to find better ways of overcoming my
backpain, and I'm hoping it'll get better someday. For now, I'm just grateful
that I can go about my day and do most things I want to do without too much
trouble. If you have any recommendations, please let me know in the comments
