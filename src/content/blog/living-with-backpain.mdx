In 2019, I had an accident at my gym - a
[slipped disc](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/slipped-disc/) injury while doing
squats. Since then, I've had varying levels of back pain, including
[sciatica](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sciatica/) for a brief period and have
had to learn to live with it. Along the way, I've picked up some techniques and
products for managing my pain, which I'd like to share in this article.

PS - This article isn't medical advice, just my personal experience. You should
always consult a doctor for medical advice.

## Osteopathy treatment

[Osteopathy](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/osteopathy) is "a way of detecting,
treating and preventing health problems by moving, stretching and massaging a
person's muscles and joints". It's a bit more hands-on than
[physiotherapy](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/physiotherapy/). When I began my
treatment, I saw significant benefits. I have a half-hour therapy session every
fortnight to keep my back pain and stiffness in check. It costs about Â£45 a
session.

## Regular exercise

I go to the gym about three days a week. My back pain usually gets worse when I
take a long break from the gym. I strictly avoid any exercises that stress my
lower back as I'm scared to injure my back again. However, I do work out my core
and back so that my muscles stay strong and help my spine out. In particular, I
do exercises that physiotherapists have advised me to do. My favourite stretch
is the knee to opposite shoulder stretch.

## Sleeping comfortably

Did you know that there are `right` and `wrong` ways to sleep? I didn't until I
saw this video. I used to love lying on my stomach, but I find it a lot easier
lying on my back since my injury. I also use pillows to raise my legs, as shown
in the video. I highly recommend the
[Recci memory foam mattress](https://amzn.to/3EDCSA7), which helps me sleep
better. I also use a [Misiki orthopaedic pillow](https://amzn.to/3hICfeE) which
helps me maintain my sleeping position better than a regular pillow.

## Sit-stand desk

In my office, I used to have a sit-stand desk. However, when quarantine and the
work from home began, I bought myself a simple table from Ikea. I debated
getting myself a sit-stand desk but delayed it because I knew it'd be a hassle
when it came to moving houses in the future. A year later, still working from
home, I finally got one. I'm delighted with this desk and the mat that I bought
alongside it.

## Pain relief

If my pain goes up following an activity, I use an ice pack for twenty minutes
to reduce inflammation. This provides a ton of pain relief.

The ice pack can be a bit of a faff sometimes, though. Biofreeze is a good
alternative, especially for when I'm outside.

Deep heat is another product I can highly recommend. It just feels so good! I
generally use it after my morning shower or before going to bed.

I do also have an electric heat pack. However, it gets a little too hot for my
liking and isn't comfortable to lie down with. So, I tend to favour the deep
heat rub over this one.

## Conclusion

Most importantly, I try not to be stupid and lift any heavy weights or do
anything that stresses my back, e.g., assembling Ikea furniture. Whenever I've
made that mistake, it's caused me weeks of agony. I dread events like going on
holiday or moving houses because I now have to rely on someone else to lift
everything for me. ðŸ˜” However, for the most part, I'm just incredibly grateful
for every second of my life that I'm not in pain and to be able to go about my
day and do most things I want to do without too much trouble.
