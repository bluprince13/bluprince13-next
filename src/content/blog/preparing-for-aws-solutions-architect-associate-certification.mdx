Recently, my wife, passed her
[AWS Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C03 exam](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/).
Following her move to the UK from India, we hoped that it would help in her web
developer job search as many roles expect some cloud experience and she had only
a little exposure to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) in her previous role. I
helped her prepare for this, and was surprised by how difficult the multiple
choice exam actually was. Apparently, the failure rate is above 72%

In this blog, I will review the certification and talk about the resources we
used to prepare for the exam.

## AWS is Amazon's Cloud product

In the past, if you wanted to create a web service you would have to buy your
own servers to host your application. It was expensive and time consuming.
Amazon, in the 2000s, released
[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud [EC2]](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/ec2) which allows
users to rent virutal computers which completely changed the game. Whereas in
the past, you'd need a dedicated indiviual or team to manage infrastructure,
these days it is fairly common for web developers to manage their own
infrastructure. Since then AWS has grown rapidly adding a plethora of cloud
infrastructure products.

## Motivation for AWS certification

It is fairly common these days for companies to expect developers to have cloud
experience. AWS currently leads the cloud market over competitors like
[Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) and
[Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com).

Whilst my wife had worked with AWS before, she did not have a ton of experience.
A friend of ours recommended AWS certification as a way of addressing the gap in
her CV. We thought it was worth a try.

My wife already had an interest in learning about architecture so she picked the
[AWS Solutions Architect - Associate certification](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/)
after looking at
[AWS's certification paths](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs/AWS_certification_paths.pdf).
We decided to skip the foundational
[AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/)
since she already had some experience with AWS and she could lean on me if she
needed any help.

## It covers more AWS services than I would like to list here!

Following are a list of some key services that I hoped the certification would
cover based on my experience of using AWS. However, if you check out the
[exam guide](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-sa-assoc/AWS-Certified-Solutions-Architect-Associate_Exam-Guide.pdf),
you can see that the certification covers way more. It looks quite daunting.

## Roadmap

### 1. Do an online course

The
[Ultimate AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate SAA-C03](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c03)
is a highly reviewed online course on AWS. This in itself will not teach you
everything you need to know for the exam, but gives you a holistic understanding
of all of the key areas and services. I would recommend not getting bogged down
on any part of the online course. It is best to go through it quickly and go to
the next step. If necessary, you can always redo the course or revisit
particular sections later.

### 2. (Optional) Play around on AWS

You do not have to check out every service on AWS, but it is nice to get a feel
for what it's like to work with AWS. My wife made a simple application,
[aws-cdk-example](https://github.com/graveend/aws-cdk-example), consisting of a
few lambdas, DynamoDb, S3 bucket, SNS and SQS. You do not have to write the
infrastructure as code (using [CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/)), but
instead you could create the resources directly in the AWS console. Just be wary
of usage beyond the [AWS Free Tier ](https://aws.amazon.com/free) and remember
to delete any resources you create.

### 3. Practice mock exams

Practicing mock exams is probably what helped the most. It's worth doing some of
the mock exams as timed exams, so you can get a feel for the time pressure and
how you're progressing. My wife scored 40% or so on her first mock exam, and got
to about 80% by the end which was her goal. When you encounter difficult
questions, do check out the AWS documentation or relevant YouTube videos/blog to
cement your understanding.

1. [AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Practice Exams](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-amazon-practice-exams-saa-c03/)

   This is a set of 6 practice tests on Udemy from Jon Bonso. You can answer
   questions interactively and get detailed explanations for each answer. These
   papers were quite hard and my wife found them the most representative of her
   real exam. She went through all of these exams at least twice.

2. [Whizlabs AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate practice exams](https://www.whizlabs.com/aws-solutions-architect-associate/)

   This includes 6 practice tests, tests on specific topics, and one final
   practice test. These were less difficult, but still very helpful.

3. [ExamTopics](https://www.examtopics.com/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c03/view/)

   This is a dump of 656 questions out of which around 300 are free. The
   questions were relatively easy. Each question also has discussions from users
   which is useful. However, there were a number of questions were users
   disagreed with the suggested `correct` answer. I would not recommend this
   resource much.

### 4. Book your exam before you feel ready

At 150 USD, the exam is quite expensive, and ideally something you could pass
the first time. However, I highly recommend that you do not wait until you feel
ready to take the exam, because that probably will not happen. My wife booked a
test in a month's time after spending two months studying for it, so three
months overall.

If you are lucky you may be able to find some discount vouchers online. We got a
50% discount for signing up to an
[Associate Challenge](https://pages.awscloud.com/GLOBAL-ln-GC-Traincert-Associate-Certification-Challenge-Registration-2023.html)
which is unfortunately now closed.

Another tip, especially if you are a non-native English speaker, is to
[request an extra 30 minutes accomodation for your exam](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/policies/before-testing/#Requesting_Accommodations).
You need to do this prior to registering for the exam. It only take a few
minutes.

## Reflections

My wife found the exam quite hard and had no idea if she passed or not.
Fortunately, we found out a few days later that she passed by a good margin. She
also received a verifiable digital badge which is now proudly displayed on her
[LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/graveend/).

 size="m"
/>

In the weeks following the exam, we noticed a slight uptick in invitations to
interviews. One interviewer even mentioned that they were impressed by the
certification. Therefore, it looks like it has had a postive impact on
employability.

The exam itself was quite tedious to study for. As you might expect, most of the
questions are about what might be appropriate services or configurations of a
service to use for a given problem. However, sometimes it was genuinely
difficult to decide between the options and the explanations were not convincing
enough. There were also some questions that required knowing such fine grained
detail that are useless in the real world. For example, one question required
knowing that for a EC2 instance, the the maximum ratio of provisioned IOPS to
the requested volume size is 50:1.

The exam did provide a good foundational understanding of AWS, and my wife was
able to have conversations about architecture with me which felt very natural,
i.e., as though she had worked with all these services herself. This was her
biggest gain from doing the certification.

Even if you already have worked with AWS, the learning process can help fill
some gaps in your knowledge, as it did for me. I couldn't be asked to actually
write the exam myself in the end though so I have no badge to display. 😛

That's all. If you have any questions or anything to add, please do comment
