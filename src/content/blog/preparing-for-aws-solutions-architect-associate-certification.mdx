Recently, my wife, [Geethu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/graveend/), passed the
[AWS Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C03 exam](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/).
Following her move to the UK from India, she hoped that it would help in her web
developer job search as many roles expect some cloud experience and she had only
a little exposure to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) in her previous role. I
helped her prepare for it and was surprised by how difficult the multiple-choice
exam was. Apparently, the failure rate is above 72%

In this article, I will list resources we used to prepare for the exam and
provide some tips.

## AWS is Amazon's Cloud product

In the past, if you wanted to create a web service you would have to buy your
servers to host your application. It was expensive and time-consuming. Amazon,
in the 2000s, released
[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud [EC2]](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/ec2) which allows
users to rent virtual computers which completely changed the game. Whereas in
the past, you'd need a dedicated individual or team to manage infrastructure,
these days it is fairly common for web developers to manage their infrastructure
themselves. Since then AWS has grown rapidly adding a plethora of cloud
infrastructure products.

## Motivation for AWS certification

It is fairly common these days for companies to expect developers to have cloud
experience. AWS currently leads the cloud market over competitors like
[Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) and
[Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com).

Whilst she had worked with AWS before, she did not have a ton of experience. A
friend of ours recommended AWS certification as a way of addressing the gap in
her CV. It was worth a try. She already had an interest in learning about
architecture so she picked the
[AWS Solutions Architect - Associate certification](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/)
after looking at
[AWS's various certification paths](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs/AWS_certification_paths.pdf).
She decided to skip the foundational
[AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/)
since she already had some experience with AWS and she could lean on me if she
needed any help.

## It covers more AWS services than I would like to list here!

Following is a list of some key services that I hoped the certification would
cover based on my experience of using AWS. However, if you check out the
[exam guide](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-sa-assoc/AWS-Certified-Solutions-Architect-Associate_Exam-Guide.pdf),
you can see that the certification covers way more. It looks quite daunting.

## Roadmap

Overall, it took about 3 months of preparation. Here is a rough timeline.

### 1. Do an online course

The
[Ultimate AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate SAA-C03](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c03)
is a highly reviewed online course on AWS. This in itself will not teach you
everything you need to know for the exam but will give you a holistic
understanding of all of the key areas and services. I would recommend not
getting bogged down on any part of the online course. It is best to go through
it quickly and go to the next step. If necessary, you can always redo the course
or revisit particular sections later.

### 2. (Optional) Play around on AWS

You do not have to check out every service on AWS, but it is nice to get a feel
for what it is like to work with AWS. Even before deciding to go for the
certification, she had made a simple application,
[aws-cdk-example](https://github.com/graveend/aws-cdk-example), consisting of a
few lambdas, DynamoDb, S3 bucket, SNS and SQS. You do not have to write the
infrastructure as code (using [CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/)) like she
did, but instead, you could create the resources directly in the AWS console.
Just be wary of usage beyond the [AWS Free Tier ](https://aws.amazon.com/free)
and remember to delete any resources you create.

### 3. Practice mock exams

Practising mock exams is probably what helped the most. It is worth doing some
of the mock exams as timed tests, so you can get a feel for the time pressure
and how you are progressing. She was scoring less than 40% on her first few
timed tests and got to about 80% by the end of three months which was her goal.
When you encounter difficult questions, check out the AWS documentation or
relevant YouTube videos/blogs to improve your understanding.

1. [AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Practice Exams](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-amazon-practice-exams-saa-c03/)

   This is a set of 6 mock exams on Udemy from Jon Bonso. You can answer
   questions interactively and get detailed explanations for each answer. These
   papers were quite hard and she found them the most representative of her real
   exam. She went through all of these exams at least twice.

2. [Whizlabs AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate practice exams](https://www.whizlabs.com/aws-solutions-architect-associate/)

   This includes 6 mock exams, tests on specific topics, and one final mock
   exam. These were less difficult, but still very helpful.

3. [ExamTopics](https://www.examtopics.com/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c03/view/)

   This is a dump of 656 questions out of which around half are free to access.
   The questions were relatively easy. Each question also has discussions from
   users which is useful. However, there were several questions where users
   disagreed with the suggested `correct` answer. I would not recommend this
   resource much.

### 4. Book the exam before you feel ready

At 150 USD, the exam is quite expensive, and ideally, something you could pass
the first time. However, I highly recommend that you do not wait until you feel
fully ready to take the exam because having a bit of time pressure could be motivating.
You can
[reschedule your exam](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/policies/before-testing/#Scheduling_Exams)
later if necessary. She booked the exam after spending two months studying for
it and gave herself another four weeks to study.

If you are lucky you may be able to find some discount vouchers online. She got
a 50% discount for signing up to an
[Associate Challenge](https://pages.awscloud.com/GLOBAL-ln-GC-Traincert-Associate-Certification-Challenge-Registration-2023.html)
which is unfortunately now closed.

Another tip, especially if you are a non-native English speaker, is to
[request an extra 30 minutes of accommodation for your exam](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/policies/before-testing/#Requesting_Accommodations).
You need to do this before registering for the exam. It only takes a few
minutes.

## Reflections

The exam itself was quite tedious to study for. As you might expect, most of the
questions are about what might be appropriate services or configurations of
services to use for a given problem. However, sometimes it was genuinely
difficult to decide between the options and the explanations were not convincing
enough. Some questions required knowing such fine-grained detail that is useless
in the real world. For example, one question required knowing that for an EC2
instance, the maximum ratio of provisioned IOPS to the requested volume size is
50:1. The
[pass mark of 720/1000](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/training-and-certification/demystifying-your-aws-certification-exam-score/)
was also difficult to achieve.

She found the actual exam quite hard and was not confident she had passed it.
Fortunately, she found out a few days later that she passed by a good margin with
a score of 803. She also received a verifiable digital badge which is now
proudly displayed on her [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/graveend/).

 size="m"
/>

In the weeks following the exam, she noticed a slight uptick in invitations to
interviews. One interviewer even mentioned that they were impressed by the
certification. Therefore, it looks like it has had a positive impact on
employability.

The exam did provide a good foundational understanding of AWS, and she felt more
at ease having conversations about AWS architecture. This was her biggest gain
from doing the certification, as she will be apply that knowledge in her next
role.

Even if you already work with AWS, the learning process can help fill
some gaps in your knowledge, as it did for me. I couldn't be asked to write the
exam myself in the end though so I have no badge to display. ðŸ˜›
