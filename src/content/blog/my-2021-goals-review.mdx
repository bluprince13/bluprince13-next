It's that time of the year, and I wanted to take some time to review what this
year has been like and what I'd like to achieve in 2022.

## 2021 goals review

Around this time last year, I wrote about
[my 2021 new year resolutions](/blog/my-2021-new-year-resolutions/). Here is a
quick review.

## Goals for 2022

Here are the new goals I want to achieve in 2022.

### 1. Get good at programming

I want to continue to improve my programming skills. At work, I want to:

- Get faster at solving more straightforward problems.
- Handle more complex problems and designs.

At home, I want to learn technologies that I don't use at work:

- Get comfortable with [Go](https://go.dev/) - as my 3rd language.
- Develop a medium complexity mobile app using
  [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).
- Learn to use [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/).
- Collaborate with my partner (who is also a developer).

### 2. Become conversational in Spanish

A carryover goal. I started reading Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in
Spanish this year. I enjoy this, and I want to finish reading it by the end of
next year. I also want to continue practising Spanish with my teacher every
week.

### 3. Create YouTube content

A carryover goal. I want to give YouTube video making a real shot in 2022. And
it's okay if I only create 1-2 videos and decide to give up after that. 🎬

## Conclusion

The older I get, the more I want to spend time just relaxing, either by myself
or with my loved ones. Therefore, it's important not to commit to doing too many
other things. Goals 2 and 3 above feel easy enough to do as long as I'm
committed. Goal 1 is a bit demanding, but given coding is my only real hobby
these days, it should also be achievable. I'm looking forwards to 2022. 🥳

Thanks for reading my last article of the year. I wish you a happy new year!
