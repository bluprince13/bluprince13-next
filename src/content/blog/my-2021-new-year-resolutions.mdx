Whoa! What a year, huh? I had such high hopes for this year having only just
moved to London and finally made my hobby into a career. However, looking back,
this year was just crap. :disappointed: I realise that the end of this year
won't magically cause all my problems to disappear. However, it still feels nice
to think of this as a time for a reset. :upside_down_face: In this article, I
will talk about my new year resolutions.

## 1. Get healthier

A carry-over goal from last year. Both physically and mentally, 2020 took a massive
toll on me. In particular, losing access to the gym during lockdowns was a shock to
my system. :sob: However, I realise now that all I can do is adapt to the situation
and whatever curveballs life might throw at me. Shout out to my parents for
inspiring me! No matter what happens next year, I want to make sure I get enough
exercise, eat healthily and take care of myself. :muscle:

    should be to cut down on the
    number of selfies I take! ðŸ¤”"

## 2. Speed up at programming

I'm nowhere near as fast as I'd like to be at programming - both at work and in
my personal projects. :running: Partly, this is because I have so much more to
learn. I want to continue to learn as much as I can next year, especially about
[front-end
development](https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2018/what-is-a-FD.html)
and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). :nerd_face: However, there are also many
behavioural changes I can work on to improve my efficiency. For example, I need
to better focus on what I need to deliver and avoid going off course.
Thankfully, I have an incredible team to draw inspiration from and learn from.

## 3. Become conversational at Spanish

I've been trying to learn Spanish for several years on and off. ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ This year I
decided to make it a priority, and I am happy about my progress. I am grateful
to my friends Ruzin and Sharmila for motivating me, and my teacher Claudia.
:pray: My goal is to be able to converse with my Spanish friends by the end of
next year. Â¡Buena suerte para mi! :crossed_fingers:

## 4. Create more content

I previously had a blog at [vipinajayakumar.com](https://vipinajayakumar.com/).
It was made using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a [go](https://golang.org/) based
[static site
generator](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/14/what-is-a-static-site-generator-and-3-ways-to-find-the-best-one/).
It worked quite well for blogging, but I didn't feel very confident modifying
the website myself. Therefore, this year, I migrated to
[bluprince13.com](https://bluprince13.com/). My new website uses the [Next.js
framework](https://nextjs.org/) and [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), which I
already know and love. ðŸ¥³ I'm also psyched to have added support for
[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) which allows embedding
[JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) within
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). :smirk: Basically, it means
it'd be straightforward for me to add cool new features in my blog articles. I'm
pretty happy with the result. Now that the stage is set, I want to write as much
as I can in 2021 and improve my writing skills. As you can see in the video
below, I also experimented with YouTube this year. :clapper: Videos could help
me explain stuff that I just can't through writing. However, making videos also
takes a lot more effort. I want to make more videos next year and decide whether
I want to keep doing it in the long-term.

## 5. Search for a life partner

Career-wise, I'm fairly confident that software development is what I want to
dedicate the rest of my life. Now that's out of the way; I want to focus on
finding my life partner. :blush: A new goal for this year. I just hope she
exists. :sweat_smile:

## Conclusion

There are other goals I wish I could set for myself, e.g., learn to play the
piano. Unfortunately, there simply isn't enough time. :sob: This is probably
more than enough goals for this year to keep me busy. It'd be awesome if I could
achieve some of it. :crossed_fingers: Have you decided what your new year
resolutions are?
