Next month, December 9, 2020, it'll be one year since I became a software
developer. Deciding to leave engineering and find a job in tech was
difficult. It was especially challenging for someone without the privilege of a
British passport nor any substantial previous experience in software
development. However, through a combination of perseverance and sheer luck, my
dream came true. In this article, I revisit my motivation for changing careers.
I hope that this will be useful to anyone in a similar position.

## I enjoyed being an engineering student

As an A-Levels student, I had no idea what I wanted to be when I grew up. I knew
I loved Physics, Math and Computer Science, but that didn't help me narrow down
my career options. At the time, I leaned heavily towards Physics and Math rather
than Comp Sci. I enjoyed learning to code for my A-Levels and had an excellent
teacher whose classes I always looked forward to. However, I didn't find the
programming language we used, [Visual
Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic), appealing.

I went on to do Aerospace Engineering at the University of Bath, UK. I loved
being a student. Some lectures fascinated me so much that I couldn't go to sleep
at night! In my 3rd year, I learnt
[Matlab](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html?requestedDomain=). I
liked coding again, but Matlab, much like Visual Basic, didn't excite me. I
gravitated towards Aerodynamics and Turbulence, mostly because I found them
mind-boggling. The things that we struggle to understand, hold a strange power
over us.

I aimed to become a researcher and professor, staying in academia. Sadly, my
research ambitions were destroyed when, in my final year at university, I was
rejected by all ten universities that I applied to. Luckily, I had an offer in
hand to join a graduate scheme at a reputable aircraft engine manufacturer that
I had already done a couple of internships with. With a heavy heart, I entered
the industrial world. To my surprise, I preferred the industrial world to the
world of academia. I liked the increased focus on delivery, and I enjoyed being
part of a team rather than the solitary figure that I imagine most academics
to be.

After a year and a half long graduate scheme, I was excited to get a permanent
role in the Noise team. Turbulence & Noise was my most favourite and challenging
subject at university.

## Working as an engineer is very different from studying to be an engineer

Of course, reality rarely measures up to our expectations. On the bright side, I
had an incredible team of highly inspiring people around me that I enjoyed
working with. Working for an aircraft engine manufacturer also meant an
abundance of exciting and challenging problems. I was the Noise work-stream lead
on an engine. I was responsible for the delivery of various milestones such as
designs, engine tests and for acting as an interface between my company and the
air-framer.

    reference="thepointsguy"
/>

Unfortunately, the role and I weren't made for each other:

-   I enjoy solving Math and Physics problems. However, the problems I solved at
    work were mostly logistical. Indeed, most engineering problems concern the
    logistical problem of utilising available human resources and machines to
    solve a problem within the given time and cost constraints. The R&D problems
    that I perhaps would have enjoyed were outsourced to universities.
-   I prefer to work alone for the most part. In my role, I hardly had any time to
    myself and was in meetings nearly all day.
-   I prefer to work on one problem at a time. However, I found myself with too
    many tasks to juggle, which was mentally exhausting.
-   I prefer proactive, slow and steady work. However, most of the work I did was
    reactive and even 'crisis management' like.
-   With a high workload and low resources, I was always in a high-pressure
    environment. My company was also actively trying to downsize. I couldn't see
    how my interests and development would ever be prioritised in such an
    environment.

There were stark differences between studying engineering and being an engineer.
Whilst the former gave me a sense of purpose and happiness, the latter I found
draining.

## I discovered a passion for coding

In my last attachment of the graduate scheme, I worked for the Noise team. I was
asked to create a Python program to parse various text files and display plots.
I had to learn Python first since I had never used it before. For the first
time, I fell in love with a programming language. Writing in Python feels like
you're expressing logic the way it is meant to be; concise and pure.

I forced myself to use Python actively for the work I needed to do. I would do
calculations and plots in Python instead of Microsoft Excel. This route
sometimes cost me more time as there was a learning cost. I built my own Python
library to make my day to day work easier. I also started engaging with other
software developers at my company.

One evening, following a presentation at work, I was chatting with the presenter
about the limitations of Python for UI development. He recommended that I look
into web development and [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) in particular. The web
was complicated to get my head around at first, but before long, I was having
more fun writing [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) than I
ever did with Python. Whilst JavaScript is not quite as neat as Python is, it
opens up the possibility of creating User Interfaces. Front-end or UI
development, where you can see and interact with the thing that you're
developing, is immensely satisfying.

The obvious next step was to move to a software developer team. However, I was
on a [UK Tier 2 VISA](https://www.gov.uk/tier-2-general). The visa restricted me
to work for my company in a `Design and development engineer` role only. I'd
need to apply for a new VISA. First, my company would have to advertise a job
vacancy nationally to prove that there were no suitable workers already living
permanently in the UK, aka a [resident labour market
test](https://www.gov.uk/uk-visa-sponsorship-employers/job-suitability).
However, my company had a hiring freeze on at the time and wasn't able to do
this.

## To learn modern software development practices, I'd need to leave engineering

That was my cue to start looking for jobs externally. Several factors persuaded
me to search for jobs in the tech industry rather than engineering. As far as
I'm aware, most engineering companies are lagging when it comes to software
development technology & culture.

-   They lack essential software development tools, restricting developers from
    achieving their full potential.
    -   Microsoft Excel and VBA are severely overused to make programs. The logic
        behind the calculations is neither easily readable nor testable.
    -   In older companies, engineers may need to interact with programs running on
        [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) machines from decades ago which
        have yet to be replaced.
    -   Data is stored as text files or spreadsheets on network drives that have
        loose access controls rather than on secure, regularly backed-up databases.
    -   Software usage is restricted to an allowed list. Getting access to anything
        not on the list is near impossible. Developers cannot access the latest
        developer tools or open-source code. Nor do they have admin access on their
        laptops. Paranoid leaders prefer to secure Intellectual Property behind an
        overly restrictive firewall, even at the cost of productivity.
    -   Forget [CI/CD](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-ci-cd). There
        is not even a central git repository manager (like
        [Github](https://github.com/) or Gitlab) so that developers can collaborate
        easily.
    -   There is no easy way to spin up servers to deploy [web
        APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API). Web APIs provide a
        language-agnostic way for applications to talk to each other directly.
        Without them, applications sit in silos, and slow, unreliable humans are
        required to interface between them.
    -   It is tough even to share static web applications such as this blog.
    -   Access to
        [IDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) is
        limited. Even free for commercial use IDEs, such as
        [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or
        [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), may not be on the list of
        allowed software.
    -   No access to Macs. Only god awful Windows! I acknowledge that this perhaps
        wouldn't be a big problem for most.
-   Processes (mandated documentation, reviews, etc.) have to be followed to
    develop new software - even for a ten-line application. The documentation and
    review slides are seen by more eyes than the actual code! It disincentivizes
    software developers to create and share code.
-   Larger software development projects are outsourced. Investments are made into
    big projects based on monolithic rather than micro-service based
    architectures. These typically take multiple years to deliver any value, that
    is, if they are not scrapped halfway. [Agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/) is
    a foreign concept.
-   No clear career progression route for software developers nor very many senior
    developers to learn from.
-   The IT strategy is bonkers. A lot of buzz words like digital transformation,
    AI etc. are thrown about, but the leadership is not interested in tackling
    the fundamental problems as listed above.

Smart, determined employees, could deal with and solve these problems if it
were easy for them to effect change. However, that tends not to be the case.
Change/progress happens too slowly, in order of years. Outdated, risk-averse and
unambitious IT leaders block progress.

If the company is also struggling financially, then a vicious cycle ensues.
Naturally, the priority for a sinking ship is to stay afloat. In other words,
money is diverted away from investments for the future to activities that keep
the lights on. This makes it even harder to make profits. I sympathise with the
plight of such companies, but this is capitalism. You snooze, you lose.

I hypothesise that these problems are characteristic of the engineering industry
globally. They collectively failed to keep up with innovations in software
development from the 90s onwards. In November 1987, MS Excel was released on
Windows. The resultant massive productivity boost meant that engineers didn't
need to be able to code as much anymore. The shallow learning curve for a
spreadsheet was just too seductive. For the next couple of decades, the industry
missed out on innovations in web development and cloud architecture amongst
others. Now, they are struggling to survive in the new digital world. Basic
software development skills aren't taught to engineering students in most
universities even now, but that's a topic for another day.

The only way I could experience and learn the latest software development
practices was to work in the tech industry. There were also a few other things
that appealed to me about the tech industry. Software developers command higher
salaries compared to engineers. I wanted to live in a big city like London,
where tech companies tend to be based. Their principles and cultures resonated
with me, e.g., [Amazon's leadership
principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles) or Spotify's culture
wonderfully explained in the video below.

## My desire to find happiness outweighed my fears

Was I throwing away my ~£100k degree in engineering, four years of studying and
another four years of working in the industry? What if I failed to get a job as
a software developer? What if I failed at being a software developer? What if I
regret leaving engineering? What if I miss the Science? What if it's too
difficult to make new friends in London? These were questions that I considered
carefully.

The only thing I knew for sure was that I was not happy where I was. I didn't
fancy living if it meant continuing on the career trajectory that I was on.
Coding made me feel satisfied. A shot at happiness was worth any risk.

In late 2018, my request to move to a software development team was rejected and
I immediately began applying for software developer roles in the tech industry.
It wasn't until October 9, 2019, that I got my first offer. Why did it
take me a whole year? How did I work towards my goal? I'll explore these in a
follow-up article. Please let me know what you thought about this one or any
questions you have in the comments below.
