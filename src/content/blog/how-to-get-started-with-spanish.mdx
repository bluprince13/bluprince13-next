I feel like I'm finally making progress in learning Spanish. I'm now able to
converse with others - albeit still with some difficulty. As I work towards
conversational fluency, I thought I'd share my learning experience with you.
This article is aimed at anyone who's just started learning Spanish or thinking
about it. I link to several learning resources, mostly recommended to me by
friends. Some methods did not work for me, but you may want to try them anyway.

## Why am I learning Spanish

It's good to know what motivates you when going about a new challenge. I want to
learn a third language because:

- Learning a language is fun - this is my no. 1 reason.
- I want a mental challenge in something not related to my day job
  (programming).
- Speaking three languages would be cool.

I felt inspired to start learning Spanish by the Bollywood movie,
[Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1562872/).

Additionally,

- Spanish is the
  [world's 4th most spoken](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Spanish_language)
  language. It would be so amazing to visit Spanish speaking countries and
  converse with people in their language.
- Pronunciation is easy-peasy in Spanish as every letter is pronounced the same
  everywhere.

## Reading / Vocabulary

Reading is a great way to pick up vocab and get familiar with the patterns of a
language. Start with beginner-friendly books such as the one below from Olly
Richards.

I learnt English by reading Harry Potter every day. So, I thought I'd try the
same technique with Spanish by reading Harry Potter y la piedra filosofal.
Although it's a bit difficult, I enjoy it because it takes me back to my
childhood days.

**Discarded**

**[AnkiApp](https://www.ankiapp.com/) / spaced repetition / flashcard apps**
help build your vocabulary. The premise is that you need to review words at
increasingly spaced out intervals to ensure that it sticks in your brain. I
tried this for a while, adding every new word I encountered to my AnkiApp and
reviewing words every morning. I did not enjoy the process and decided to focus
on other methods. However, it's worth giving it a try.

## Listening

I love Spanish learning courses in the form of audiobooks. It's a great way of
training your ear whilst also picking up new words or grammar skills. I usually
do my listening for half an hour before going to bed or just after I wake up.
Listening on the tube/bus works too. Top tip: Say the stuff you hear out loud
for better memory retention.

1. **[Michel Thomas Beginner Spanish](https://amzn.to/3dKO1Df) - 7 hours**

   This dude is such an awesome instructor. He does have a pretty thick French
   accent, which takes some getting used to. However, of all the audiobooks I've
   listened to, this is the most entertaining. His passion for languages and
   teaching is obvious. I also like how he focuses a lot on pronunciation,
   especially those damn tildes. Try listening to the sample for
   [Lesson 1](https://amzn.to/3dKO1Df). There are seven lessons in all.

2. **[Learn Spanish with Paul Noble](https://amzn.to/3hBf1Gf) - 13 hours**

   Paul has a very similar setup to Michel. Not quite as entertaining, but much
   more of a professional feel.

3. **[Next Steps in Spanish with Paul Noble for Intermediate Learners â€“ Complete Course](https://amzn.to/3dKPCJf) -
   8 hours**

   I was thrilled to discover that there was more Paul Noble!

4. **[Pimsleur](https://www.pimsleur.com/learn-spanish-latin-american/all-products) -
   75 hours**

   These courses are a tad expensive. Rather than buying the courses, I opted
   for a monthly subscription hoping that I'd save some money in the long run if
   I go through them fast enough. You can try it
   [free](https://offers.pimsleur.com/free-trial-1404) for 7 days. I only did
   level 4 and am just finishing with level 5 at the moment.

5. **[Language Learning with Netflix](https://languagelearningwithnetflix.com/)**

   Finally, an excuse for watching Netflix without feeling guilty. This Chrome
   extension lets you see both English and Spanish subtitles at the same time.
   It works well. Although, bear in mind that studying a movie is a little more
   taxing than just watching it. ðŸ˜…

## Conversation

At some point, you'll become good enough to need conversational practice. I
highly recommend **online 1:1 classes**. I use the app
[italki](https://www.italki.com/). I have an hour-long class with a Mexican
every week. In most classes, we talk about random stuff. In others, we revise a
particular tense. The regularity of the sessions themselves is something I find
very useful. Even if I'm lazy for one week and don't do any self-study, the
class helps me stick with the long-term programme.

I tried finding **language exchange partners** using apps like
[Tandem](https://www.tandem.net/). The idea is that you help someone else who
wants to learn English whilst they help you with your Spanish. When I tried this
a few years ago, it didn't go too well, as I'm not overly fond of texting as a
mode of communication. However, I'm now giving Tandem another go to see if I can
get more value out of voice calls.

**Discarded**

I've tried **in-person group classes**. Whilst I enjoyed being in a classroom
environment with other students and have had some outstanding teachers; I didn't
think it was good value for money as the teacher has to split their attention
between ten or so students. If you'd like to try for yourselves, then you could
look for adult learning services or community classes offered by universities.

## Grammar

Some find it helpful to practice grammar directly by revising tenses or doing
grammar exercises. I find it too dull. However, I do think it's essential. I use
**[Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/)** to get my grammar practice in a
slightly less boring way.

## Conclusion

Currently, I dedicate about three hours or so to learning Spanish every week. It
includes an hour-long class, reading Harry Potter, listening to audiobooks and
using Duolingo. This multi-faceted approach feels not only effective but also
very enjoyable to me. Of course, the true test and best way of learning is
complete immersion. My plan is to go on holiday in Spain, hopefully next year,
to give that a go.

That's all, folks. Leave me some feedback if you have any. I'd also appreciate
any recommendations that you may have for Spanish learning tools. Â¡Buena suerte para ti!
